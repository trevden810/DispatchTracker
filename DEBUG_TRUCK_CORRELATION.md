# üîç ENHANCED DEBUGGING - Truck ID Field Analysis

## Problem Identified ‚ùå
- **Vehicle number extraction**: ‚úÖ WORKING (`[56]`, `[67]`, `[86]`, etc.)
- **Available truck IDs from FileMaker**: ‚ùå ZERO (`Available truck IDs (0):`)
- **Result**: No matches possible when FileMaker has no truck IDs

## Enhanced Debug Logging Added ‚úÖ

### 1. FileMaker Field Analysis
Added comprehensive logging to show ALL potential truck/driver fields:
```bash
üîç Job XXXXX FIELD ANALYSIS:
   *kf*trucks_id: 'VALUE' -> parsed: NUMBER
   *kf*route_id: 'VALUE' 
   *kf*driver_id: 'VALUE'
   order_C1: 'VALUE'
   Customer: 'CUSTOMER_NAME'
```

### 2. Invalid Truck ID Detection
Shows exactly why jobs don't have truck IDs:
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è Job XXXXX has invalid truckId: 'VALUE' (type)
```

## Root Cause Analysis üîç

From your FileMaker screenshot, I can see:
- **Lead/Driver column**: Shows "77" (likely driver ID)
- **Route column**: Shows "1" (route number)
- **Vehicle numbers**: 56, 67, 74, 81, 85, 86, 70, 804, etc.

**Hypothesis**: The `*kf*trucks_id` field is either:
1. Empty/null in FileMaker
2. Contains driver IDs (77) not truck numbers (56, 67, etc.)
3. Uses a different field name than expected
4. Contains text values that aren't parsing as numbers

## Immediate Testing Steps üß™

**Restart dev server and look for:**
```bash
cd C:\Projects\DispatchTracker
npm run dev
```

**Key debug output to check:**
1. **Field Analysis**: What values are actually in `*kf*trucks_id`?
2. **Invalid Truck IDs**: How many jobs show invalid truck ID warnings?
3. **Available Fields**: What other fields might contain truck numbers?

## Expected Debug Results üìä

**If truck IDs are missing:**
```
üîç Job 896883 FIELD ANALYSIS:
   *kf*trucks_id: 'null' -> parsed: undefined
   *kf*driver_id: '77'
   order_C1: '1'
‚ö†Ô∏è Job 896883 has invalid truckId: 'null' (object)
```

**If using wrong field:**
```
üîç Job 896883 FIELD ANALYSIS:
   *kf*trucks_id: 'null' -> parsed: undefined  
   *kf*driver_id: '77'                          ‚Üê MIGHT BE THE CORRELATION
   order_C1: '1'                               ‚Üê OR THIS FIELD
```

## Potential Solutions üí°

Once we see the debug output, we can:

1. **Use different field**: If `*kf*driver_id` contains truck numbers
2. **Update field mapping**: If FileMaker uses different field names
3. **Add field request**: If truck IDs aren't available in current layout
4. **Alternative correlation**: Use route + customer + location matching

**The enhanced debugging will show us exactly what's available in FileMaker!**

**Status**: ENHANCED DEBUGGING READY - Restart server to see field analysis
**Next**: Analyze debug output to determine correct truck correlation field
