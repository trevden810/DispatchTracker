File: `lib/route-correlation.ts` - Already implemented with these features:
- Vehicle-to-route matching by truck ID
- Stop sequence tracking using order_C1
- Route progress calculation (completed vs total stops)
- Proximity detection for assigned jobs only

### **Key Functions Available**
```typescript
correlateVehiclesWithRouteAssignments(vehicles, jobs)
// Returns: Array of route assignments with progress tracking

calculateRouteProximity(vehicle, assignment)  
// Returns: Distance to assigned job location only

getRouteSummary(assignments)
// Returns: Fleet-wide route progress statistics
```

### **Integration Points**
```
