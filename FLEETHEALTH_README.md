## 🔄 **HOW TO MOVE TO NEW CLAUDE PROJECT**

### **1. Copy Core Files**
Take these files to the new project:
- `app/health/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `app/api/health/status/route.ts` - Health monitoring API
- This README for context

### **2. Project Context to Share**
```
"I'm building FleetHealth Monitor, a real-time vehicle health dashboard for PepMove's fleet management. I have the initial files created and need to enhance/test the system. The app analyzes Samsara vehicle diagnostics (coolant temp, oil pressure, battery voltage, fuel level) and provides traffic light status indicators (red/yellow/green) for 50+ vehicles. Uses existing DispatchTracker APIs at www.pepmovetracker.info."
```

### **3. Dependencies Already Available**
- Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Existing Samsara API integration

### **4. Immediate Testing Commands**
```bash
# Test health API
curl https://www.pepmovetracker.info/api/health/status

# View dashboard
https://www.pepmovetracker.info/health
```
