# DispatchTracker - Enhanced Fleet Management System

**Real-time GPS tracking correlated with FileMaker job assignments for logistics specialists**

## 🎉 Project Status: ROUTE FIELDS ADDED - READY FOR ENHANCED CORRELATION

**Major Achievement**: Database administrator has added all requested routing fields to FileMaker jobs_api layout. The enhanced vehicle-to-job correlation system is now ready for implementation and testing.

**Immediate Priority**: Test and implement the route-based correlation algorithm to enable accurate vehicle-job assignments.

## 🚛 IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY: Route Correlation Implementation

### **Current Issue**
- ✅ All FileMaker routing fields now accessible
- ✅ Enhanced correlation algorithm implemented
- ❌ **Need to test and activate route-based vehicle assignments**

### **Expected Transformation**
**Before**: "0 trucks have assigned jobs"  
**After**: "Truck 77 - Route 2, Stop 3 of 7"

### **Available Route Data** 
```typescript
// NOW ACCESSIBLE from FileMaker:
routeId: 2,              // _kf_route_id (Route assignment)
stopOrder: 3,            // order_C1 (C1 column sequence)  
driverId: 456,           // _kf_driver_id (Driver assignment)
driverStatus: "En Route" // job_status_driver (Current status)
```

## 🎯 Next Developer Instructions

### **Use MCP Tools Strategically:**

#### **1. Filesystem Tools (Primary)**
```bash
# Read current route correlation implementation
Filesystem:read_file("C:\Projects\DispatchTracker\lib\route-correlation.ts")

# Test current API response with new fields
Filesystem:read_file("C:\Projects\DispatchTracker\app\api\jobs\route.ts")

# Review vehicle tracking integration
Filesystem:read_file("C:\Projects\DispatchTracker\app\api\tracking\route.ts")
```

#### **2. Analysis Tool**
```javascript
// Test the new routing fields in production
const response = await fetch("https://www.pepmovetracker.info/api/jobs?limit=5")
const jobs = await response.json()

// Verify routing fields are populated
jobs.data.forEach(job => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id}: Route ${job.routeId}, Stop ${job.stopOrder}`)
})
```

#### **3. Web Research & Development**
- Research best practices for route optimization algorithms
- Find examples of vehicle-job correlation in logistics systems
- Investigate advanced proximity detection methods

### **Priority Tasks (In Order)**

#### **Phase 1: Route Field Verification (30 minutes)**
1. **Test new FileMaker fields**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://www.pepmovetracker.info/api/jobs?limit=3"
   ```
   Expected: routeId, stopOrder, driverId fields populated

2. **Verify data quality**:
   - Check if route assignments match screenshot (Route 2, etc.)
   - Validate stop sequences (C1 order: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
   - Confirm truck-to-route correlations

#### **Phase 2: Enhanced Correlation Implementation (2 hours)**
1. **Update tracking API** to use route-based logic instead of proximity-only
2. **Implement stop sequence tracking** for route progress
3. **Test vehicle assignment accuracy** with real route data
4. **Deploy enhanced correlation** to production

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Same day)**
1. **Route progress dashboard**: "Truck 77 - Route 2, Stop 3 of 7"
2. **Proximity alerts for assigned jobs only**: No false alerts
3. **Driver performance tracking**: Real completion times per stop
4. **Customer service enhancements**: Accurate ETA predictions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Guide

### **Key Files to Modify**
```
lib/route-correlation.ts    # ✅ Already implemented - ready to activate
app/api/tracking/route.ts   # Update to use route-based correlation
lib/types.ts               # ✅ Updated with routing fields
```

### **Expected API Response (After Implementation)**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "vehicleId": "Truck 77",
      "routeId": 2,
      "currentStop": 3,
      "totalStops": 7,
      "progress": "43%",
      "assignedJobs": [
        {
          "id": 64479,
          "customer": "50222 SEATTLE - QUEEN ANN",
          "stopOrder": 3,
          "status": "En Route",
          "location": {"lat": 47.6205, "lng": -122.3493}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

## 📊 Business Impact Opportunity

### **Current State**
- 51 vehicles tracked but showing "0 assigned jobs"
- Dispatchers cannot see vehicle-to-customer correlations
- Manual coordination required for job assignments
- Customer service gaps due to lack of accurate tracking

### **Potential After Implementation**
- **100% vehicle-job correlation accuracy**
- **Real-time route progress**: "Stop 3 of 7 complete"
- **Automated dispatcher alerts**: Driver arrivals, delays, completions
- **Enhanced customer service**: "Your driver is 2 stops away"
- **Operational efficiency**: 50%+ reduction in coordination overhead
