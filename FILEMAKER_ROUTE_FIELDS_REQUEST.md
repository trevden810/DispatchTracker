# üöõ CRITICAL: Additional FileMaker Field Access Request\n\n**Date**: September 9, 2025  \n**Project**: DispatchTracker Enhanced Route Correlation  \n**Priority**: HIGH - Required for accurate vehicle-job tracking\n\n## üéØ BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION\n\nOur current vehicle tracking system shows vehicles but **cannot correlate them to assigned jobs** because we're missing critical route assignment data from FileMaker. This prevents dispatchers from:\n\n- Knowing which truck is assigned to which route\n- Tracking stop sequence and progress\n- Detecting when drivers arrive at assigned locations\n- Providing accurate customer service updates\n\n## üìä CURRENT PROBLEM\n\n**Screenshot Evidence**: FileMaker shows Route TRK assignments with C1 stop sequences (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) but our API cannot access this data.\n\n**Current API Response**:\n```json\n{\n  \"customer\": \"50222 SEATTLE - QUEEN ANN\",\n  \"address\": \"1630 QUEEN ANN AVENUE\",\n  \"truckId\": 77,\n  \"location\": {\"lat\": 47.6205, \"lng\": -122.3493}\n}\n```\n\n**Missing Route Data**:\n- Route assignment ID\n- Stop sequence order\n- Driver assignment\n- Route progress tracking\n\n## üîß REQUESTED FIELDS\n\nPlease add these fields to the **jobs_api** layout for the `trevor_api` user:\n\n### **Route Assignment Fields**\n```\n_kf_route_id       // Route ID (connects to Route TRK)\n_kf_driver_id      // Driver assignment\norder_C1           // Stop sequence (C1 column in screenshot)\norder_C2           // Secondary order field\n```\n\n### **Additional Location Fields**\n```\naddress_C2         // Secondary/return address\nCustomer_C2        // Secondary customer\ncontact_C1         // Primary contact info\njob_status_driver  // Driver-specific status\n```\n\n## üìà EXPECTED BUSINESS IMPACT\n\n### **Before (Current State)**\n- ‚ùå 0 trucks show assigned jobs\n- ‚ùå No route progress tracking\n- ‚ùå Manual dispatcher coordination\n- ‚ùå Customer service gaps\n\n### **After (With Route Fields)**\n- ‚úÖ Truck 77 shows Route 2, Stop 3 of 7\n- ‚úÖ \"Driver at customer location\" alerts\n- ‚úÖ Automated progress tracking\n- ‚úÖ Proactive customer notifications\n\n## üîç TECHNICAL VERIFICATION\n\n**Excel Analysis Confirms**: These fields exist in the FileMaker database:\n\n```\nColumn 8: _kf_trucks_id ‚úÖ (Already accessible)\nColumn 29: _kf_route_id ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\nColumn 24: _kf_driver_id ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\nColumn 105: order_C1 ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS - This is C1 in screenshot)\nColumn 106: order_C2 ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\nColumn 36: address_C2 ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\nColumn 64: Customer_C2 ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\nColumn 59: contact_C1 ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\nColumn 82: job_status_driver ‚ùå (NEED ACCESS)\n```\n\n## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n### **Phase 1: Field Access** (Immediate)\n1. Database administrator adds fields to jobs_api layout\n2. Update API integration to request new fields\n3. Test with sample route data\n\n### **Phase 2: Route Correlation** (Same day)\n1. Implement route-based vehicle-job matching\n2. Add stop sequence tracking\n3. Enable proximity alerts for assigned jobs\n\n### **Phase 3: Dispatcher Dashboard** (Next day)\n1. Route progress visualization\n2. Real-time job assignment display\n3. Automated customer notifications\n\n## üìû CONTACT INFORMATION\n\n**Technical Contact**: Trevor (DispatchTracker Developer)  \n**Business Sponsor**: Fleet Management Team  \n**Urgency**: HIGH - Blocking core functionality\n\n## üîê SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Read-only access** - No write permissions needed\n- **Existing user**: trevor_api (already authorized)\n- **Same layout**: jobs_api (established and secure)\n- **Data sensitivity**: Standard operational data (non-confidential)\n\n## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA\n\n**Verification Test**:\n```\nGET /api/jobs?limit=1\n\nExpected Response:\n{\n  \"routeId\": 2,\n  \"stopOrder\": 3,\n  \"driverId\": 123,\n  \"driverStatus\": \"En Route\"\n}\n```\n\n**Business Validation**:\n- Truck 77 shows \"Route 2, Stop 3 of 7\"\n- Vehicle cards display assigned customer names\n- Proximity alerts work for assigned jobs only\n- Route progress tracked automatically\n\n---\n\n**This field access request is critical for DispatchTracker to function as designed. The route assignment data exists in FileMaker but is currently inaccessible through our API integration.**\n\n**Timeline**: Request immediate approval to enable full fleet management capabilities.\n
