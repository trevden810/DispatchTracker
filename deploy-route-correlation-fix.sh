🎯 ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
❌ Vehicle tracking shows 0 trucks with assigned jobs
❌ Missing critical route assignment data from FileMaker
❌ Cannot correlate Truck 77 to Route 2, Stop sequence C1

🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Enhanced Job interface with route fields
✅ Route-based vehicle-job correlation algorithm  
✅ Stop sequence tracking (order_C1)
✅ Driver assignment correlation (_kf_driver_id)
✅ Professional FileMaker field request document

📊 FIELDS REQUESTED:
- _kf_route_id (Route assignment ID)
- _kf_driver_id (Driver assignment)  
- order_C1 (Stop sequence from C1 column)
- order_C2, address_C2, Customer_C2, contact_C1
- job_status_driver (Driver-specific status)

🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:
- Truck 77 shows 'Route 2, Stop 3 of 7'
- Vehicle proximity detection for assigned jobs only
- Automated route progress tracking
- Enhanced dispatcher workflow

📋 NEXT STEPS:
1. Submit FILEMAKER_ROUTE_FIELDS_REQUEST.md to database admin
2. Test enhanced correlation once fields are accessible
3. Deploy route-based vehicle assignment dashboard"

echo "📋 SUMMARY:"
echo "The route correlation issue is caused by missing FileMaker field access."
echo "The Excel analysis confirms these fields exist but are not accessible"
echo "through the current jobs_api layout for the trevor_api user."
echo ""
echo "Once the database administrator grants access to the routing fields,"
echo "the enhanced correlation logic will immediately enable accurate"
echo "vehicle-to-job assignments based on your actual route data."
